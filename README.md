Finding out if a Sudoku-like puzzle has only one solution

does a given Soduku-like puzzle have at least one solution? <br>
(We say "Soduku-like" because by definition a true Soduku puzzle has exactly one solution.) <br>
o make this most interesting, you would want to define a random problem generator that avoids <br>
generating problems that are trivially unsat, because they contain the same number twice in the <br>
same row or column. <br>
